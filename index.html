              <p class="mb-0 small text-muted">Enkelana ''Lana'' Drizaj proudly serves as the President of the Lodi Chamber of Commerce, 
                a role she assumed in 2025 after two years as a dedicated member. 
                With a strong commitment to revitalizing and rebuilding the Chamber, Lana is focused on creating 
                meaningful opportunities, resources, and connections for local businesses to thrive.<br><br>
                Lana brings a unique blend of legal, business, and real estate experience to her leadership. She holds a degree as Legal Assistant from
                 Bergen Community College and was a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society. 
                Before transitioning full-time to real estate in 2021, Lana worked in the Civil Division of the Bergen County Superior Court. 
                Licensed since 2012, she has built her business entirely by referral, delivering the same exceptional 
                service to a $2,000 rental client as she does to a $2 million buyer or seller.<br><br>
                In addition to her role as Chamber President, Lana is a respected leader in the real estate community. She serves as the Chair of the Global Business Council 
                and the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) Committee for Greater Bergen Realtors®. At the national level, 
                she is an active member of the Political Affairs Committee with the National Association of Realtors® (NAR), where she helps shape and advocate for policies that 
                impact homeowners and real estate professionals across the country.<br><br>
                Originally from Albania, Lana grew up in a small business environment, often accompanying her father to negotiate with wholesalers for their family's store. 
                That early exposure to entrepreneurship shaped her passion for advocating on behalf of local business owners today.<br><br>
                A Lodi resident since 2014, Lana is deeply involved in community service. In 2017-2018, she started a Girl Scout troop in Garfield to ensure her eldest daughter
                and her best friend, who has special needs, had a safe and inclusive space to belong. That same spirit of inclusion and advocacy drives her work at the Chamber.<br><br>
                Outside of work and community leadership, Lana enjoys reading, spending time with her two daughters, and finding quiet moments of reflection that keep her grounded and inspired.</p>

              <p class="mb-0 small text-muted">Anthony is a dedicated financial coach with over a decade of experience in personal and 
                professional financial development. A proud native of Hudson County, New Jersey, he has 
                transformed personal challenges into a mission to uplift his community. Growing up in a 
                single-parent household, Anthony found guidance and discipline through sports, which not only 
                kept him focused but also instilled values of teamwork and perseverance. These principles 
                paved the way for his academic journey at Saint Peter's University.<br><br> 
                In 2022, Anthony embraced his passion for mentorship by joining North Bergen High School as 
                a Varsity Football Coach, giving back to the very community that shaped him. His commitment 
                to community service extends beyond the field; he serves as the President of the Rutherford 
                Rotary Club and holds the position of Vice President at Passaic Head Start.<br><br>
                Professionally, Anthony is at the forefront of financial literacy education, focusing on bridging the 
                gap between businesses and the communities they serve. He actively develops local business 
                networks aimed at fostering economic growth and empowerment. As a finance coach, he 
                dedicates his time to teaching financial literacy, with a vision to elevate the national credit 
                average and expand workforce development programs in 2025.<br><br>
                Outside of his professional endeavors, Anthony cherishes time with his wife, Cindy, and their 
                five children. An avid outdoorsman, he enjoys climbing mountain trails, exploring new culinary 
                experiences, and engaging with diverse communities.<br><br>
                Anthony lives by the philosophy of Confucius: “If the goal cannot be reached, do not adjust the 
                goal, adjust the action steps.” This mindset continues to drive his mission to inspire, connect, 
                and educate.</p>
